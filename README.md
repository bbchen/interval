# Pomodoro timer for macOS, written in Swift

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kzys/interval.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kzys/interval)

This is a yet another Pomodoro timmer app for macOS. The features are;

- Block your screen entirely to remind you that you need to take a break, instead of sounds and/or notifications
- The remaining time is shown on the menu bar with a small pie chart icon
